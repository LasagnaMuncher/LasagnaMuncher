Hi, I am Jacob S. Lewis, PhD. I studied Physics and Materials Science. I have written software processing dirty data, controlling custom-built
lab instruments both in grad school and at national lab, numerical simulations of electrostatic attractions using Runge-Kutta methods and heat diffusion simulations using the
Crank-Nicolson Method, have done substantial data processing and modeling. I work with Python and the multitude of numerical methods and data science modules, SQL, SCPI, 
PyQt, Mathematica, HTML, Javascript, and others but I will likely only contribute Python projects here.
